A suite of tests for testing Xen Server
Luna Rossa is a suite of tests for testing Xen Server. All tests are
started from one central binary "lunarossa" and each test is implemented 
as a sub command. Luna Rossa was developed at Citrix for internal
testing. It tries to keep dependencies and assumptions about the
environment small. Implementing new tests is supported by a library.
Luna Rossa is configured through two files: servers.json and tests.json.
The first tells Luna Rossa about the hosts running Xen Server and how to
access them. The latter contains parameters for tests in the test suite.
Examples are provided.
