Synopsis: A suite of tests for testing Xen Server
Description:
  Luna Rossa is a suite of tests for testing Xen Server. Luna Rossa
  is configured through two files: servers.json and tests.json. The
  first tells Luna Rossa about the hosts running Xen Server and how to
  access them. The latter contains parameters for tests in the test
  suite. Examples are provided.

  Luna Rossa was developed at Citrix for internal testing. It tries to
  keep dependencies and assumptions about the environment small.

  One of the tests dependends on the Xen Test VM, a kernel. The test
  downloads the kernel and boots it as a guest. Executing foreign code
  is obviously a security risk.
